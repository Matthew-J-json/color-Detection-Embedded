This project was my final project for my embedded systems class.
The concept was inspired by common LED color detection software available in consumer RGB LED strips.


colorchoose.c:
	the main program which runs on a raspberry pi to build the embedded system

colordetect.py:
	a smaller program written to use openCV for color detection

POL-ece350-final.mp4:
	a proof of life demonstrating that the system works as intended
